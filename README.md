# WiFeel

Wifeel is an Android app that notifies you when you've entered
a Wifi field. It is meant to be combined with wearable tech
like the [Sony SmartBand](http://www.sonymobile.com/global-en/products/smartwear/smartband-swr10/) that can listen for app notifications and vibrate
when there is one.

By walking through your environment, you'll feel the Wifi around you. WiFeel
was inspired by those brave souls who have magnets implanted in their fingers
to feel magnetic fields.
